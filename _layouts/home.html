    <br>
    <p class="time"> I learned so much about how to foster meaningful experiences while getting my BFA in <a href=http://www.ixd.cca.edu/#bfaintro>Interaction Design at California College of the Arts</a> in San Francisco. During my time at CCA, I
        crafted many experiences for others, ranging from the the elegant and poetic speculative mobility futures with <a href=http://greenfieldlabs.com/>Ford Motors</a>, to the practicality of the future of student loan payments with <a href=http://usa.visa.com/>Visa</a>.
        In the summer of 2017 I interned as an Experience Designer at the consumer product firm <a href=http://fuseproject.com/>fuseproject</a>, where I worked on smart home fitness interfaces, and VR product demo galleries. </p> <p>In the
        summer of 2018 I collaborated on a design sprint with <a href=http://ideocolab.com/>IDEO CoLab</a> as well as designed for the consumer lending company <a href=http://blend.com/>Blend </a> as a product design intern. Here, I redesigned the
          new hire onboarding experience, BlendU, with the help of the Organization Effectiveness team. Additionally helped design for alignment within the company through the company objectives. Made interactive presentations and data visualizations
          to emphasize strong points and areas of improvement within Blend. </p> <br>

    I design to help people learn and understand more effortlessly. By emphasizing aspects of exploration and storytelling to guide the experience, I work to create engaging and intuitive design solutions that won't demand your attention away from you.
