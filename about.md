Andy designs for interactions and experiences in the Bay Area. When he's not designing, he's making functional ceramic ware for friends who didn't ask for them.

To fill in the little bits of free time, he's diving too deep into niche topics and insane facts; like the history of sweat bathing, or how sharks predate trees by 40 million years.

He's currently looking for new design opportunities, view his [resume]({{ "/assets/Shimmin_Andy_Resume.pdf" | absolute_url }}) and [portfolio]({{ '/portfolio' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), or [contact him directly](mailto:andersonrshimmin@gmail.com).

###### BACKGROUND
---
 I learned so much about how to foster meaningful experiences while getting my BFA in [Interaction Design at California College of the Arts](http://www.ixd.cca.edu/#bfaintro) in San Francisco. During my time at CCA, I crafted many experiences for others, ranging from the the elegant and poetic speculative mobility futures with [Ford](http://greenfieldlabs.com/), to the practicality of the future of student loan payments with [Visa.](http://usa.visa.com/) In the summer of 2017 I interned as a Experience Designer at the consumer product firm [fuseproject ](http://fuseproject.com/), where I worked on smart home fitness interfaces, and VR product demo galleries.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the summer of 2018 I collaborated on a design sprint with [IDEO CoLab](http://ideocolab.com/) as well as designing for the consumer lending company [Blend](http://blend.com/) as a product design intern. Here, I redesigned the new hire onboarding experience, BlendU, with the help of the Organization Effectiveness team. Additionally helped design for alignment within the company through the company objectives. Made interactive presentations and data visualizations to emphasize strong points and areas of improvement within Blend.
