      <p><p>I took a class called “From Marble to Chocolate” during the fall of my senior year in college. It was taught by Marina Pugilese. She was an Italian art historian who wanted to capture the aspects of contemporary art history from art made of marble, all the way to art made of chocolate (see Janine Antoni’s Lick and Lather).

<h1 id="impressionism--1850s"><strong>Impressionism — 1850’s</strong></h1>

<p>The impression that the light made on the landscape</p>

<hr />

<p>The invention of the portable easel allowed for artists to paint scenery</p>

<p>The study of the composition of colors</p>

<p>The invention of industrial canvases - 1863</p>

<p>Futurism was trying to represent movement. Critiqued Cubism because it felt so static.</p>

<p>Builds armatures underneath and stretches the canvas over the armatures. Paints with acrylic to suggest the females body. A side view resembles ocean waves. Purposefully erotic but also reference to topologies. Working with the slash of two canvases to make forms that jut out and recess.</p>

<h2 id="rh-quaytman--2010s"><strong>RH Quaytman — 2010’s</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/90ab8f391f4348a083702138ca416595#ac1a276f66a147789d19ff4b0388ef94"></a></p>

<p>All of her paintings on beveled wood with golden ratio dimensions. Good for putting multiple pieces together. Often references history in her works. Works in chapters, her collections of work fall under a chapter, and moves other to other chapters to make new pieces. Sometimes references past chapters</p>

<p>A point of departure for Quaytman’s newest paintings is Michael Heizer’s seminal earthwork Double Negative (1969–70), a 240,000-ton excavation and displacement of rhyolite and sandstone that takes the form of two trenches cut into the eastern edge of Nevada’s Mormon Mesa. At the outset of researching her exhibition for Los Angeles, Quaytman was drawn in by the mythology surrounding the North American desert and Double Negative’s particularly complicated relationship to MOCA, as an artwork held in the museum’s collection but one that will always and forever be outside the museum’s walls.</p>
