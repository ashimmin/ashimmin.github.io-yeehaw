&lt;h6 id=&quot;heroesines&quot;&gt;HEROES/INES&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend about who our hero/ines were, and what makes one good. I began thinking of everyone I though was heroic to me, who I aspired toward, or who was working on something inspiring. I came to the conclusion that my heroes are not just a list of people, but a timeline that resolves lessons that need to be learned. My heroes change because I learn what I needed to from them, and move on to other lessons I need to learn. I plan on asking friends about this to see what they think of this idea. Off the top of my head, I would like to address some lasting lessons that people have taught me. I may delete the names though,
&lt;br /&gt;
…
&lt;br /&gt;
As I was writing out my list, I realized that teaching lessons isn’t all there is to being a hero. There are people who I do NOT look up to who have taught me valuable things.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been talking with Weiwei a lot about the benefits of a Twitter presence. I know I’ve been overthinking the whole thing when catch myself staring into space thinking about what unique perspective I would bring to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;math&quot;&gt;MATH&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend recently gave me this math problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-five-digit-number-in-the-decimal-system-has-the-representation-a-b-c-d-e-the-digits-abcde-indicate-in-this-order-the-respective-remainder-when-dividing-the-number-by-2-3-4-5-and-6-show-that-exactly-one-number-exists-and-specify-this-number&quot;&gt;A five-digit number in the decimal system has the representation a b c d e. The digits a,b,c,d,e indicate in this order the respective remainder when dividing the number by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Show that exactly one number exists and specify this number.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew even the slightest how to go about solving this problem. It took my friend multiple explanations to even understand what it was asking. He said it was a question from a 5th grade math championship. I hope to get to a point where I can solve these problems, because they are more a riddle than a math problem it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of feelings around what craft theory means, but wanted some structure around the general consensus of its meaning. I was directed to this video titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squHaZ9pinE&quot;&gt;The Invention of Craft&lt;/a&gt;, a presentation given at CCA by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glennadamson.com/bio&quot;&gt;Glenn Adamson&lt;/a&gt;, the former Head of Research at the V&amp;amp;A Museum. It was a fascinating talk structured around craft through the lens of friction (woodworking), tension (textiles), and eccentricity (pottery). My biggest question after finishing it was, what separates this kind of craft from the craft of an expert coffee maker, or an Italian grandma making pasta? What makes something belong to craft, and another belong to skill in a given domain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;craft-should-not-be-used-to-solve-a-problem-or-be-idealized-but-to-articulate-real-human-conditions-of-production-and-skill&quot;&gt;“Craft should not be used to solve a problem or be idealized, but to articulate real human conditions of production and skill.”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;where-do-i-fit-into-design&quot;&gt;WHERE DO I FIT INTO DESIGN?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the first time in months I felt motivated by the thought of design. After attending an “AEC disruption” panel, a discussion about the confluence of architecture and design in tech, I came to a couple of realizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design is a blanket term people like to use to hide their poor product decisions. So often, people (PM’s, eng, and designers) drop words like “user testing” and “efficiency” and convince others that what they did was intentional. I was reminded after this panel that I need to be aware of not doing the process because “that’s what you do”, but because it is necessary to have a better understanding of the problem at hand—if it’s even a problem to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are so many small efforts I can make as an individual to create change in the grander scope. What’s that one saying? The seed doesn’t see the flower it grows? I’m still making a lot of connections between ideas as I transition out of college and need to respect my current pace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future Andy, small things that make a big difference include: Finishing the SuperHi courses you bought, writing things down instead of keeping them in your head, continuing to read books, and forming long term habits. As much as you tell yourself you’re in sapling phase, you’re still a bright aspirational seed in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;sweat-bathing&quot;&gt;SWEAT BATHING&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still reading up on sweat bathing. I just finished Mikkel Aaland’s chapter about the Turkish Hammam in his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikkelaaland.com/sweat.html&quot;&gt;SWEAT.&lt;/a&gt; I was able to experience communal bathing at the Kabuki Spa in SF’s Japantown. This spa has a mixture of many baths, including a hot and cold pool, a dry sauna, as well as a steam room. The idea of cleaning your body as an activity outside of your home is extremely foreign to me, but definitely underrated. Speaking of bathing being weird, In 1854, The Encyclopedia Britannica wrote about something called a “bath cabinet” for personal sweat bathing. I guess it’s so you wouldn’t have to bathe in a way that revealed yourself to others, but it looks more embarrassing than any amount of time in a communal bath, a probable cause for why it never gained popularity in America.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.mikkelaaland.com/images/privatesweats.jpg?crc=23608230I&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikkelaaland.com/mediterranean-baths.html&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; of Mikkel Aaland’s book SWEAT.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I left Kabuki absolutely &lt;em&gt;radiant&lt;/em&gt;. I would love to visit other spas in the city to compare experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;data-visualization-presentation&quot;&gt;DATA VISUALIZATION PRESENTATION&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the second draft of a presentation I’ve been working on for how to visualize data. I have the structure in a good place but need to get feedback to clarify my thinking. The biggest challenge has been narrowing down all the examples I would like to include that have helped me understand DV better. Also so I’ll be able to talk about my perspective on DV without sounding like a maniac or needing 3 hours to explain everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johannes and I also spoke about something very important to me that I’ve been revisiting all week: To study something as a craft, versus to study something as a discipline. To me, craft learning is from your own desire or interest in a topic, coming to conclusions based on your own observations and research; while a discipline is very externally driven by a “curriculum.” So a school for example. I still need to structure what I mean by craft and discipline, but for now I have a much better relationships with my craft-scaffolded knowledge.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employees at Blend progressed at their own pace, with the option to explore specific areas of the process that were more confusing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a new-hire onboarding product I made with the Organization Effectiveness team to introduce complex compliance topics during first week orientation. To begin, I interviewed employees about their current understanding related to these topics, and addressed those areas in an engaging and playful interactive tool that could be easily shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/disclosures.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist the Org Effectiveness team with onboarding after I transitioned off the project, I created an Sketch-based illustration library for them to use to generate visual elements for the different chapters of the onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/illus.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- ![](/assets/blend/headerfooter.gif) --&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/illusexamples.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt; &lt;em&gt;All illustrations were drawn in Sketch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Before you can make a difference, you need to know the space your working in. This was perfect to educate myself as well as the rest of my peers on a small but very important facet in the application process—disclosures.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

For my first project, I created an onboarding tool as part of the new-hire onboarding experience that educated and refreshed Blend employees on a variety of mortgage and compliance related concepts. The bulk of this tool focused on an interactive demo of how mortgage disclosures— infamous for being tedious, granular, and a necessary evil for borrowers and lenders—operated within the ecosystem of lending. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Asking around, most of the questions were general, “What are the contents of a disclosures package?” “Why do we need them?” What compliance issues do they face?” --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MAKING SENSE OF LOAN ORIGINATION&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/disclosurespaper.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journey map of the loan origination process. Each color represents a different perspective. ex: orange = the borrower’s journey, pink = Blend’s influence, blue = disclosures, and so on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;okrs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;okr-dashboard&quot;&gt;OKR DASHBOARD&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/blend/okreducation.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;small&gt;*A video educating employees on Blend's current goals and what they mean.*&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal on this project was to redesign the company’s OKR dashboard to help align the company toward their quarterly goals. The final result was a multi-touchpoint service initiative that informed employees &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Blend chose these specific product goals, and to provide metrics that had both meaning and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;br&gt;This became much more of a service design project rather than just a visual refresh of the existing dashboard. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/solution1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The refreshed OKR dashboard gives priority and trajectory to current goals, instead of a single data point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dashboard needed to be easy to update regularly, but also needed some visual treatment that was beyond the capabilities of Google Slides or Tableau, the current software Blend was using to visualize their OKRs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIREFRAMES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/okrwireframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above images are wireframes I created to test different ways of showing metrics. The left column is what the visualization will look like, the right column is the background image used for the Tableau dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ![](/assets/blend/oldokr.png) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blend/beforeafter.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;small&gt;*Blend's OKR Dashboard before the refresh. Equal hierarchy, and no easy way to understand what is shown.*&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ![](/assets/blend/okrfoamcore.jpeg)
&lt;small&gt;*Three phases I identified to understanding OKRs: education, updating &amp; informing, taking action.*&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blend was accommodating with my own curiosities during my internship. From working on visualizations with the data team one day, to an animated prototype demo for a client onsite the next, I was thrown into a fast-paced environment that honed my ability to make connections from all faces of the company. My biggest take away was developing an understanding of how to listen to the needs of the company, and being okay with not knowing the solution. The lending industry is extremely ingrained in archaic processes, and learning about it was a huge undertaking— designing for it even more so.

&lt;h6 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work on interfaces for learning aims to empower people to create meaningful relationships with their knowledge to support a mind of deep interest and curiosity, so that even the biggest problems can be deconstructed and understood. The final prototypes I created are a glimpse at the possibility of what screen-based learning could be, but the future for learning goes beyond the screen to enhance how one learns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been entertained by these videos; super clean, super simple, super &lt;em&gt;delicious&lt;/em&gt;, and easy to follow. And after we finish it, we have a tendency to click on another, and another, and another. Youtube rabbit holes are an easy thing to go down, and even though educational content is abundant online, it’s usually in the form of entertainment like this. We never call Youtube rabbit holes educational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s okay, because if i wanted to learn about African animals except elephants I will find exactly what I need—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/elephants.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to find something online that teaches you something, but rarely is it shown through an educational lens. And that’s because an educational lens is a classroom, a teacher, other students, and the surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/medium.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt; &lt;em&gt;Medium telling me what else I might like in the footer of the website. None of these are related to what I just read.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the internet isn’t that. It’s not any of those, Its a lot of “up next’s” and “suggested readings,” not based on what I’m currently doing, but based on my entire browsing history. So it needs to be up to the learner to mediate those resources online. In an age of abundant online educational media, it is important that we are able to treat these self-learning resources as something that we can shape and direct, rather than something that tells us to consume more of what it thinks we like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year I have been trying to answer the question:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-we-assist-learners-in-navigating-through-online-resources-effectively&quot;&gt;How can we assist learners in navigating through online resources effectively?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through interviews with teachers, public speakers, students, academics, and hobbyists, I categorized my understanding of learning into three main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we effectively find and accept quality content from online resources in a sea of junk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we organize it in a way that makes sense to us?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and how can we discuss this with others to deepen our understanding of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/model.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and they all flow together as the process of learning happens.
This became the fundamental model for what learning should include during my investigation on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I researched existing examples of interfaces that have these categories, but found they tend to prioritize one, and struggle to navigate between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take a look at what interfaces do and don’t do well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;existing-examples-of-learning-interfaces&quot;&gt;EXISTING EXAMPLES OF “LEARNING INTERFACES”&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/laptopyt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youtube is a great example of how an interface that has so much content for learning, isn’t presented in a way to support it. If I go to a video to learn about something, but I’m looking for ONLY the part I care about, I have to click through the entire video to find it. There are thumbnail previews, but that’s only a visual cue, so auditory explanations are not benefitted from that. If I want to discuss this with others, I have to leave the video and scroll down to the comments. If a comment is time stamped, I click and leave the comments to see the part of the video they were talking about, only to have to scroll back down to see the discussion around the snippet of video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a slightly different note, Google has an uncommon feature when searching some questions into it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/whistle.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where it gives you a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+whistle&quot;&gt;suggested clip&lt;/a&gt;. Google will highlight specific parts of a video and tell you which moments in the video it believes are most relevant to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is &lt;a href=&quot;http://watson.ted.com/&quot;&gt;IBM Watson’s TED website&lt;/a&gt;. Here, you can ask IBM’s Watson a question or topic and it will search every TED Talk for videos that it thinks are related to your inquiry. Just like the Google search, it clips the part of the video that is relevant to you, and starts the video from there, as you can see from the teal bar below the video. But this interface as well as Google’s suggested clip still just surfaces content for consumption, and neglects the other essential parts of a learning environment that people need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/2by2.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;digging deeper, I looked to different types of learning platforms to see how they dealt with this problem. It all varied based on what information you are looking for, and how deeply you want to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources like Youtube, Reddit and Quora have a wide breath of content, that is both academic and interest heavy, but are focused, based on their interfaces, on entertaining or consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources that are educational and academic employ a classroom like setting, or a sequential learning style, with an emphasis on knowledge quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two quadrants together have quality learning material, but because of the interface itself, we as learners aren’t empowered to retain this information through note taking or discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other spaces, theres not many examples. But these are the two spaces that I see the most promise in, specifically, educational interest based learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-an-interface-for-learning-look-like&quot;&gt;What does an interface for learning look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching possible companies in that upper right region, I partnered with a company called Alcamy, who were working on a similar problem. Alcamy is a self learning platform that curates existing learning materials online so you can find helpful learning resources all in one place.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/laptopalcamy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their current website, which you can visit now, uses user created categories that filter entire topics into a streamlined curriculum. Together we worked to re-create their existing interface for one that promoted more than just consumption, so that if someone wanted to learn more about bitcoin, for example, they would find value in Alcamy whether they knew a lot or not much at all.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/albert.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Meet Albert, an avid bitcoin purchaser, he knows a lot about the basics, and he’s trying to learn about unstable currencies for his next crypto purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/ridic.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
He’s really frustrated with his current attempts to learn about it on youtube and reddit, as he keeps getting video suggestions that steer him away from his topic through exaggerated titles and ostentatious thumbnails, and the lack of quality discussion in the comments prevents Albert from really diving deep into his topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/intro.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;prototype&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;prototype&quot;&gt;PROTOTYPE&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Alcamy, he finds the topic he’s looking for, and see’s Unstable Currency is already a discussion category. He is able to skip the sections about bitcoin he already knows and can immediately access Unstable Currencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/3sections.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new interface, Albert has some additional tools to help him grasp this concept. and there are three columns to accompany Albert’s learning journey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A place for note taking, where he can write down his thoughts, drag quotes and snippets, and have a place for him to help solidify his learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a space for the actual content he’s learning from, and I will talk more later about navigating through it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, a place for discussion with communities interested in the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the video, Albert has questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/comments.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He writes a quick conversation starter, drags it over to the discussion section, and In no time, he get’s a clarifying response from someone else interested in learning about the same topic as him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the three part interface, Albert doesn’t have to keep scrolling between commentary and video like youtube and can focus on his learning over navigating. Which is critical during points when you are just starting out, as there is so much more to take in.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/jane.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, like Jane, who knows nothing about bitcoin, she’s curious what all the buzz is about, and is looking to learn more. She’s found some great information watching TED talks, but is looking for a place to help her unscramble her thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/janecomment.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She starts from a beginner topic, and picks up the basics quickly. She’s can choose different ways to digest the content based on her preference. Jane jots down some notes and drags her comments to the notes section. Now, she’s interested in a certain part of the video, and grabs the scrub bar to refine the discussion a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/msdetail.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media scrubber, located directly on the video timeline allows Jane the ability to look at discussion and commentary from both the macro and micro level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/mscontext.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when Jane alters the scrubbers size and location, it filters the comments to just that part of the video rather than the video as a whole, allowing for more directed discussions that the long comment threads we’re used to don’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/thesis/scrubberuse.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She scrubs to a specific section to see what the discussion is about for that part of the video, only to find that someone asked her question! The response links her to another page, and she finds the exact quote that the commenter was referencing. she is able to copy the highlighted section directly to her notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;LEARNINGS&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/thesis/modelonui.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work on learning interfaces aims to empower people to create meaningful relationships with their knowledge to support a mind of deep interest and curiosity, so that even the biggest problems can be deconstructed and understood. Looking at what defines an interface that helps someone learn is my step toward that. These two scenarios were looking at learning from a digital interface, but it stems far beyond just the digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to bring my learnings from my work here with me in my future work, as i look at making technology not something that alleviates us in the moment, but supports us over time as we grow and develop ways to make education better.&lt;/p&gt;
