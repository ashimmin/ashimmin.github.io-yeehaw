[Clarke's Three Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws "1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.                 2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.                                                       3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.")

[The Presumptions of Science](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/62179/1/20024542.pdf "I find this article to time and time again be relevant when discussing the future of technology and its reach into other areas of human kind. In the article, he cites three areas where research has a potential for "dubious merit." Isotope fractionation, for fear of inevitable nuclear terror. The search and contact for extraterrestrial intelligence, proposing that if we get a response they are either as technologically advanced or more. And the postponing of age, which dangers an already overcrowded planet.") by Robert Sinsheimer
