###### ADVICE FROM OTHERS

Jonathan Lachman's advice on being an effective communicator in meetings:
1. Set the table. Meetings are expensive so make sure they push the agenda forward. A way to do that is to level set with the people in that meeting beforehand, find out where they're coming from and what they care about so you can address it during that meeting.
2. Frame the meeting. Not like "Hey what should we do?"  But rather, "I've been thinking about A+B and I would really like feedback on C/D" or something along those lines to give context to the feedback. [(See Jack Cohen's narrating the change)]()
3. Consider who you're talking to. The devices you use to guide a meeting vary if it's a CEO or a colleague.
4. "Weaponize" the agenda. Use it as a tool to guide the meeting if it goes on tangents: "I'd love to talk with you later about this topic but I would like to focus on X" or some parking lot type technique. Same applies to pushing ideas forward. If someone higher up requests, you can leverage the meeting in that direction if necessary. "CEO wants us to do X, and what I'm suggesting aligns with that objective."
5. Like mentioned in 4, use diplomatic language to steer the conversation.
6. Practice and get feedback. [(See Jack Cohen's asking for feedback)]()
7. Measure effectiveness in terms of how much influence you've had in getting your agenda adopted/implemented over time. (Did you move the objective forward after the meeting?)
8. Everyone's experience is different so 7 becomes very subjective.

When asking how to be more effective:
1. Use the [stages of competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) model to help level set progress of a given topic (Am I uncon comp, or am I con comp?)
2. Adopt "personas" to be effective. (this is my blues and gray sky persona and it's good at this, this is my red-yellow persona and its good at this etc.) Note: As you develop these, you might even investigate the relationship between them.
3. Once a day ask for feedback, starting with "is there a..."  is harder to answer. Instead you might try:
a. ask it right after an interaction in which you were working on the problem
b. Frame it as "I'm working on [specific growth area]. Can you tell me one thing see me doing that's working/effective here, and one thing I could more of/differently to do it more effectively?
