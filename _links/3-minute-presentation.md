Hi Andy,
Helpful summary! I feel the commitment to learning :)

 A couple quick things:
2. Yes! And as you develop these, you might even investigate the relationship between them.
3. I thought we'd said once/day--but you get to choose. Also, the phrasing is key. The "is there a..." way you ask it is harder to answer. Instead you might try:
a. ask it right after an interaction in which you were working on the problem
b. Frame it as "I'm working on [specific growth area]. Can you tell me one thing see me doing that's working/effective here, and one thing I could more of/differently to do it more effectively?

Looking forward to hearing how it goes!
