I've had many portfolio website attempts before this one. I was always frustrated with how tedious it was to add content, or build a look I wanted from template websites. This website is an attempt to have a website that recruiters, designers, humans and myself can use as a resource for design related material.

I've always experienced a push and pull between what I find appealing that's a current trend and what actually speaks to me. A main reason is that so many different styles can all speak to you, so it's hard to find one that works.

When I was first making my website I was heavily constrained by what I wanted to convey, and what the audience of my website wanted to see. Recruiters have a very specific list of things they look for and if there's too much fluff, it's over. At some point my website stopped becoming a representation of me and became more of a hub that showed my work.

---I dreaded working on my portfolio, and I still do because a website is rarely the correct medium to show interaction design work to begin with. Displaying a screen on a screen, with a video of interactions, or a clip of animation. It's extremely easy to smoke an mirror your whole design talent.---
