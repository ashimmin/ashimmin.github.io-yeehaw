I've had many portfolio website attempts before this one. I was always frustrated with how tedious it was to add content, or build a look I wanted from template websites. This website is an attempt to have a website that recruiters, designers, humans(?), and myself can use as a resource for design related material.

When designing my website, I've always experienced a push and pull between what I find appealing that's a current trend and what actually speaks to me. So many different styles can all speak to me, but any single cohesive style gets lost within every other style.

When I was first making my website I was heavily conflicted by what I wanted to convey, and what the audience of my website wanted to see. Recruiters have a very specific list of things they look for and if there's too much fluff, it's over. At some point my website stopped becoming a representation of me and became more of a hub that showed my work.

I dreaded working on my portfolio, and I still do, because a website is rarely the correct medium to show interaction design work to begin with. Displaying a screen on a screen, with a video of interactions, or a clip of animation. It's extremely easy to fabricate your whole design talent.

I wanted to spend some time and go through each website design I've made for myself, to see what kind of progress I've made as a designer, or what I found important during those times in my life.

This was my first attempt at coding my website. Wanting to code it myself, I was way over my head. Note the personalized thumbnails. An attempt at showing attention to detail but ultimately just created tons of work with little payoff.

This attempt at a website was much more thought out in some areas, and not so much in others. I had a friend introduce Semplice, a Wordpress theme, to me and said you could accomplish anything with it. I proceeded to meticulously design my dream site down to the pixel only to find out that Semplice in fact doesn't do everything. I had to sacrifice a lot but the effort to even get started using Wordpress or Semplice was ten headaches combined. I finished it unsatisfied. I still think this website is very successful with just a few tweaks. Pulling it off is another story.

Here is a detail from a portfolio piece. I wanted to have the product images emphasize sections of information, but the tools I was using weren't capable of such things.

My third attempt and most recent. Using markdown made coding so much more approachable, and going for a to-the-point theme was the perfect balance of challenge and productive. For now I'm very happy with this layout, but I'll always be a sucker for the tiny features.

 A big change to get to this point was turning my personal "portfolio" into an informal writing section, like what this post is. By giving the appearance that I'm creating something for me, I can show a lot more works I've done without feeling like I'll be dinged points for not representing immediately hirable skills all the time.
