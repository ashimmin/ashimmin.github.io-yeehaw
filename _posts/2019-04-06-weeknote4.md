###### HEROES/INES
---
I was talking with a friend about who our hero/ines were, and what makes one good. I began thinking of everyone I though was heroic to me, who I aspired toward, or who was working on something inspiring. I came to the conclusion that my heroes are not just a list of people, but a timeline that resolves lessons that need to be learned. My heroes change because I learn what I needed to from them, and move on to other lessons I need to learn. I plan on asking friends about this to see what they think of this idea. Off the top of my head, I would like to address some lasting lessons that people have taught me. I may delete the names though,

As I was writing out my list, I realized that teaching lessons isn't all there is to being a hero. There are people who I do NOT look up to who have taught me valuable things.
