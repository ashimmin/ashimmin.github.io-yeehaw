###### CRAFT
---

I have a lot of feelings around what craft theory means, but wanted some structure around the general consensus of its meaning. I was directed to this video titled [The Invention of Craft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squHaZ9pinE), a presentation given at CCA by [Glenn Adamson](https://www.glennadamson.com/bio), the former Head of Research at the V&A Museum. It was a fascinating talk structured around craft through the lens of friction (woodworking), tension (textiles), and eccentricity (pottery). My biggest question after finishing it was, what separates this kind of craft from the craft of an expert coffee maker, or an Italian grandma making pasta? What makes something belong to craft, and another belong to skill in a given domain?
