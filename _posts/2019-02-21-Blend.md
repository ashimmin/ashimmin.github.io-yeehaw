###### INTRODUCTION
---
As Blend's first product design intern, I was tasked to work on two primary projects to help bring clarity to the company's complex problem space.

###### INTERACTIVE ONBOARDING PRODUCT
---
For my first project, I self-directed and created a new-hire onboarding product to introduce and simplify complex compliance topics during first week orientation— specifically mortgage disclosures. To begin, I interviewed various departments about their current misunderstandings related to disclosures, and used those findings to address those areas in an engaging and playful interactive tool that could be easily shared around the office. Feedback was clear that employees at Blend finished knowing how disclosures fit into lending, how to design around them, and why they're so important for the transparency of the loan application. To assist in updating people in the long term, I created a component library of illustrations for articles and resources to be presented in a more engaging format.


<!-- Before you can make a difference, you need to know the space your working in. This was perfect to educate myself as well as the rest of my peers on a small but very important facet in the application process—disclosures.
<br>
<br>

For my first project, I created an onboarding tool as part of the new-hire onboarding experience that educated and refreshed Blend employees on a variety of mortgage and compliance related concepts. The bulk of this tool focused on an interactive demo of how mortgage disclosures— infamous for being tedious, granular, and a necessary evil for borrowers and lenders—operated within the ecosystem of lending. -->



<!-- Asking around, most of the questions were general, “What are the contents of a disclosures package?” “Why do we need them?” What compliance issues do they face?” -->

###### OKR DASHBOARD
---

My second project was to redesign the company's OKR dashboard to align the company toward their quarterly goals. This dashboard needed to be easy to update regularly, but also needed some visual treatment that was beyond the capabilities of Google Slides or Tableau. The final result was a multi-touchpoint service initiative that informed the company of *why* Blend chose their product goals, and to provide metrics that had both meaning and direction— something that a simple dashboard refresh wouldn't have been able to accomplish.

###### FINAL THOUGHTS
---
Blend was accommodating with my own curiosities during my internship. From working on visualizations with the data team one day, to an animated prototype demo for a client onsite the next, I was thrown into a fast-paced environment that honed my ability to make connections from all faces of the company. My biggest take away was developing an understanding of how to listen to the needs of the company, and being okay with not knowing the solution. The lending industry is extremely ingrained in archaic processes, and learning about it was a huge undertaking— designing for it even more so.
