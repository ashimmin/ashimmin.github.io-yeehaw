excerpt:  As a Product Design intern at Blend, a white-label SaaS company, I worked on two primary projects to help bring clarity to the consumer lending space. One was a product that visualizes complex compliance topics for new hires, and the other a new dashboard for the company's objectives. <br><br> I worked on other projects during my time at Blend, feel free to ask about my work in further detail!

###### INTERACTIVE ONBOARDING PRODUCT

<br>

For this project, I created a new-hire onboarding product with the Organization Effectiveness team to introduce complex compliance topics during first week orientation. To begin, I interviewed employees about their current understanding related to these topics, and addressed those areas in an engaging and playful interactive tool that could be easily shared.

To assist the Org Effectiveness team with onboarding after I transition off the project, I created an Sketch-based illustration library for them to use to generate visual elements for the different chapters of the onboarding experience.

<!-- Before you can make a difference, you need to know the space your working in. This was perfect to educate myself as well as the rest of my peers on a small but very important facet in the application process—disclosures.
<br>
<br>

For my first project, I created an onboarding tool as part of the new-hire onboarding experience that educated and refreshed Blend employees on a variety of mortgage and compliance related concepts. The bulk of this tool focused on an interactive demo of how mortgage disclosures— infamous for being tedious, granular, and a necessary evil for borrowers and lenders—operated within the ecosystem of lending. -->



<!-- Asking around, most of the questions were general, “What are the contents of a disclosures package?” “Why do we need them?” What compliance issues do they face?” -->

###### OKR DASHBOARD

The goal on this project was to redesign the company's OKR dashboard to help align the company toward their quarterly goals. The final result was a multi-touchpoint service initiative that informed the employees ***why*** Blend chose these specific product goals, and to provide metrics that had both meaning and direction.

<!-- <br>This became much more of a service design project rather than just a visual refresh of the existing dashboard. -->

<br>
<br>
<br>

This dashboard needed to be easy to update regularly, but also needed some visual treatment that was beyond the capabilities of Google Slides or Tableau, the current software Blend was using to visualize their OKRs.

###### FINAL THOUGHTS
---
Blend was accommodating with my own curiosities during my internship. From working on visualizations with the data team one day, to an animated prototype demo for a client onsite the next, I was thrown into a fast-paced environment that honed my ability to make connections from all faces of the company. My biggest take away was developing an understanding of how to listen to the needs of the company, and being okay with not knowing the solution. The lending industry is extremely ingrained in archaic processes, and learning about it was a huge undertaking— designing for it even more so.
