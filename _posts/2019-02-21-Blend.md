###### INTRODUCTION
---
**For NDA reasons, I am not able to show my work on the product, but instead I can show you some side projects I was able to produce during my time at Blend.**

Mortgage lending is a small and overlooked "area" due to the percentage of people who interact with loan applications or lenders regularly. Blend comfortably and confidently fits in this space, assessing the needs of both mortgage lending institutions as well as those applying for a loan, and making the process more accountable for both parties and overall more fluid and stress-free. My time at Blend as the first product design intern was filled to the brim with opportunities to learn about something I had never given a second thought— and ultimately, to help make  lending better.

###### ONBOARDING TOOL
---
Before you can make a difference, you need to know the space your working in. This was perfect to educate myself as well as the rest of my peers on a small but very important facet in the application process—disclosures.
<br>
<br>

For my first project, I created an onboarding tool as part of the new-hire onboarding experience that educated and refreshed Blend employees on a variety of mortgage and compliance related concepts. The bulk of this tool focused on an interactive demo of how mortgage disclosures— infamous for being tedious, granular, and a necessary evil for borrowers and lenders—operated within the ecosystem of lending.

<small>*I needed to map my thoughts before hopping into the computer. Each color represents a different perspective. ex: orange = borrower journey, pink = Blend, blue = disclosures, etc.*</small>
<br>
<br>

Asking around, most of the questions were general, “What are the contents of a disclosures package?” “Why do we need them?” What compliance issues do they face?”

The final result had to be engaging enough for viewers to stay focused, but explained in a way so one could retain the information they were reading. The final result was a witty, interactive story of how Marc (with a "C") borrower handled disclosures during his loan application. Feedback was clear that employees at Blend left knowing how disclosures fit into lending, how to design around them, and why they're so important for the transparency of the loan application.

###### OKR DASHBOARD
---
OKR's help to align a company toward actionable goals. Some may be ambitious, but they help inspire and steer employees at all levels in the right direction.

This project was devoted to amplifying that unity component, and making Blend's alignment forward clear and simple.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Blends current dashboard was hyper-straightforward with an intensity that lost all clarity in the process.

The first major problem was automation: How can we update these screens in a way that supports some visual design adjustments and automatic updating of the objectives? Having to manually update these numbers in Sketch each week was out of the question, but so was a Tableau dashboard that had negative hierarchy.

<br>

I explored ways in which we could maximize Tableau's potential for visual clarity and sketched ways to call out changes in the data that showed the trend of each metric we were measuring— rather than a stand-alone data point.

<br>


After slowly crafting a proposed solution in Tableau, the design team and I collectively agreed that a successful OKR wasn't about reorganizing the information; rather, it was about educating Blend employees on *how* to look at the dashboard, not *what* to look at. As Ray, a product designer, mentioned, "Treat the OKR dashboard as a service design project."

<br>


It became clear that there were three phases to this project: an initial "educate" phase, the "update and inform" phase, and finally, a "take action" phase. The solution I had been working on only focused on updating and informing.

I worked to analyze and understand what and how Blend needed to be educated on our company objectives.

To address the "Educate" portion, I created an animated video describing each of the company's OKR's, and what they mean in a larger context.

Because of NDA purposes, I'd love to talk about my work with Blend's new product offering in person. Thank you for understanding.

###### FINAL THOUGHTS
---
Blend was so accommodating with my own curiosities during my internship. From working on objectives one day, to an animated demo for a client onsite the next, I was thrown into a fast-paced environment that honed my ability to make connections from all faces of the company. My biggest take away was developing an understanding of how to listen to the needs of the company, and being okay with not knowing the solution. The lending industry is extremely ingrained in archaic processes, and learning about it was a huge undertaking— designing for it even more so.
