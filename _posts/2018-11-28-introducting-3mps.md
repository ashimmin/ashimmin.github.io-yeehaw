excerpt: 3 minute presentations and how I will format them. Instead of giving up when I don't understand something, I want to spend time with the concept and try to really pick it apart until I understand what it means.

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Miexriir/status/1041371285761122305), I wanted to challenge myself to learn something new, but to also try and visualize it in a timely manner so others can learn as well. Referencing [Blooms Taxonomy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Blooms_rose.svg),  I hope to understand each concept enough to apply it in a written/visual format (level 3 on the taxonomy), and I hope people who view my presentation will at least be able to comprehend the learning (level 2).

###### WHY WILL I MAKE THESE?
---
I want to see how easy or hard it will be to distill complex information into something clear, simple, and short to read.

I will spend a maximum of 1 hour making these presentations.

something that's been on my mind that week (which will be next weeks presentation)

Example:


[Volts, Watts, Amps, Ohms](/assets/3MP/3mp01_Shimmin_Andy.pdf)

What is the difference between each of these and how to they alter how electricity flows through something.
