This is the first week of weeknotes, to hold myself accountable for making progress in my personal interests and career, but to also to see if I can last beyond this post.

###### WHERE DO I FIT INTO DESIGN?
---

This week was the first time in months I felt motivated by the thought of design. After attending an "AEC disruption" panel, a discussion about the confluence of architecture and design in tech, I came to a couple of realizations:

1. Design is a blanket term people like to use to hide their poor product decisions. So often I'm seeing people (PM's, eng, and designers) drop words like "user testing" and "efficiency" and convincing others that what they did was intentional. I was reminded after this panel that I need to be aware of not doing the process because "that's what you do", but because it is necessary to have a better understanding of the problem at hand—if it's even a problem to begin with!

2. There are so many small efforts I can make as an individual to create change in the grander scope. What's that one saying? The seed doesn't see the flower it grows? I'm still making a lot of connections between ideas as I transition out of college and need to respect my current pace.

For future Andy, small things that make a big difference include: Finishing the SuperHi courses you bought, writing things down instead of keeping them in your head, continuing to read books, and forming long term habits. As much as you tell yourself you're in sapling phase, you're still a bright aspirational seed in the ground.

###### SWEAT BATHING
---
I'm still reading up on sweat bathing. I just finished Mikkel Aaland's chapter about the Turkish Hammam in his book [SWEAT.](https://www.mikkelaaland.com/sweat.html) I was able to experience communal bathing at the Kabuki Spa in SF's Japantown. This spa has a mixture of many baths, including a hot and cold pool, a dry sauna, as well as a steam room. The idea of cleaning your body as an activity outside of your home is extremely foreign to me, but definitely underrated. Speaking of bathing being weird, In 1854, The Encyclopedia Britannica wrote about something called a "bath cabinet" for personal sweat bathing. I guess it's so you wouldn't have to bathe in a way that revealed yourself to others, but it looks more embarrassing than any amount of time in a communal bath, a probable cause for why it never gained popularity in America.

Anyway, I left Kabuki absolutely *radiant*. I would love to visit other spas in the city to compare experiences.

###### DATA VISUALIZATION PRESENTATION
---
I finished the second draft of a presentation I've been working on for how to visualize data. I have the structure in a good place but need to get feedback to clarify my thinking. The biggest challenge has been narrowing down all the examples I would like to include that have helped me understand DV better. Also so I'll be able to talk about my perspective on DV without sounding like a maniac or needing 3 hours to explain everything.

Johannes and I also spoke about something very important to me that I've been revisiting all week: To study something as a craft, versus to study something as a discipline. To me, craft learning is from your own desire or interest in a topic, coming to conclusions based on your own observations and research; while a discipline is very externally driven by a "curriculum." So a school for example. I still need to structure what I mean by craft and discipline, but for now I have a much better relationships with my craft-scaffolded knowledge.
