###### INTRODUCTION
---

**1,051,031** new legal permanent residents moved to U.S in 2015.

Many of these immigrants didn’t know a lot of important information about laws or customs unique to that region before moving to it. My group found that alarming and serious. There was an opportunity to assist travelers in a way that wasn't stale or unengaging.

My team and I asked 31 international students, families, and recent visa applicants about how they felt about the information they knew prior to moving to the US.

<br>

> ### [“I know so little, I just wish I knew more about how my taxes work, what my legal housing and labor rights are.”]()

<br>
## [22 of the 31]()
survey participants said they didn’t know the laws of a new country before moving.

## [16 of the 31]()
people said they didn’t research laws before they moved.

## [14 of the 31]()
participants mentioned they wanted to know about laws around housing, drugs, and starting a business.

###### COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS & PROBLEM AREAS

<br>
Looking online to try and understand the laws, people are quickly faced with a series of government text fields, whacky trivia, and a general scattering of the information they needed.

How might we…


> Help people learn about the law and cultural norms when traveling to a new country?

> Bridge divides between immigrants and the laws of a new place?
