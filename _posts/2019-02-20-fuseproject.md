Many of the projects I worked on during my internship are still under NDA. During my time at fuseproject, I was able to work on the first interactions for a home fitness workout machine, as well as the entire workout experienceâ€” from the technology embedded in the machine, all the way to the digital interfaces and its surrounding touchpoints.

Additionally, I spent some time learning how to 3D model and worked on a VR Demo Gallery concept for fuseproject and their clients. Fuseproject often had to share their ideas on the road or on-site. Carrying various different prototypes quickly became cumbersome. This project offered to create a VR environment to show clients recent products using a Google Daydream. Prototypes were made in Blender and Unity.

<!-- Here are some of the render's I created while learning the software. Inspired by the work of [Beeple.](https://www.beeple-crap.com/)

If you are interested in learning more about my work at fuseproject, I'd be happy to talk more about it in person.
