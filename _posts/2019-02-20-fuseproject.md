Many of the projects I worked on during my internship are still under NDA. During my time at fuseproject, I was able to work on the first interactions (sweat included) for a home fitness workout machine, as well as the entire workout experienceâ€” from the technology included in the BOM all the way to the digital interfaces and its surrounding ecosystem.

Additionally, I spent some time teaching myself how to 3D model to apply to a VR demo gallery concept. Fuseproject often had to share their ideas on the road or on-site. Carrying various different prototypes quickly became cumbersome. This project offered to create a VR space to show clients our products using a Google Daydream and models of some of our current projects. I worked in Blender and Unity.

If you are interested in learning more about my work at fuseproject, I'd be happy to talk more about it in person.
