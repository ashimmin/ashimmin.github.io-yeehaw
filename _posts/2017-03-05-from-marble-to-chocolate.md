I took a class during the fall of my Senior year called From Marble to Chocolate taught by Italian art historian Marina Pugilese. It covered a material history of modern art. From pieces made from marble all the way to chocolate. (See lick and lather by) This class changed how I look at art entirely. This post is all the notes I took during the semester.

The invention of industrial canvases - 1863

Futurism was trying to represent movement. Critiqued Cubism because it felt so static.
