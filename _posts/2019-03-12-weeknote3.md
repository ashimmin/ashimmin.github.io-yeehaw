###### TWITTER
---
I’ve been talking with Weiwei a lot about the benefits of a Twitter presence. I know I’ve been overthinking the whole thing when catch myself staring into space thinking about what unique perspective I would bring to Twitter.

###### MATH
---
A friend recently gave me this math problem:

#### A five-digit number in the decimal system has the representation a b c d e. The digits a,b,c,d,e indicate in this order the respective remainder when dividing the number by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Show that exactly one number exists and specify this number.

I wish I knew even the slightest how to go about solving this problem. It took my friend multiple explanations to even understand what it was asking. He said it was a question from a 5th grade math championship. I hope to get to a point where I can solve these problems, because they are more a riddle than a math problem it seems.
